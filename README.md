# PCLatFoam
OpenFoam solver for the simulation of the thermal and fluid flow behaviour of Phase Change Material / Lattice structure composites. The solver is an extension and readaptation the OpenFOAMv9 of the CoMeTFoam solver (https://github.com/geo-fluid-dynamics/CoMeTFoam).
The solver includes a Darcy-Brinkman term to account for the fluid flow within the porous medium (lattice structure). Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE) is used for the energy equation.
